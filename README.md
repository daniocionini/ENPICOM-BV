# ENPICOM BV Application
## Maximum Matching code (Python)
In “Perfect Matchings and RNA Secondary Structures”, we considered a problem that required us to assume that every possible nucleotide is involved in base pairing to induce an RNA secondary structure. Yet the only way this could occur is if the frequency of adenine in our RNA strand is equal to the frequency of uracil and if the same holds for guanine and cytosine.

We will therefore begin to explore ways of counting secondary structures in which this condition is not required. A more general combinatorial problem will ask instead for the total number of secondary structures of a strand having a maximum possible number of base pairs.
